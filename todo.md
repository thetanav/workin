# workin Feature Roadmap

## HIGH

## TODOs
- [ ] **Future Check-ins**: "I'll be working at [Coffee Shop] tomorrow morning."
- [ ] **User Follow/Friend System**: See specifically where your friends are working.
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Web Push for "Wave" alerts and "Friend nearby" notifications.
- [ ] **"Focus Mode" Toggle**: Allow users to check in but mark themselves as "Do Not Disturb" (red ring on map avatar).
- [ ] **Direct Messaging**: Simple ephemeral chat when both users are checked in nearby.
- [ ] **Venue Ratings**: Rate locations based on "Wifi Speed", "Coffee Quality", "Noise Level", and "Outlet Availability".
- [ ] **Space Directory**: detailed pages for popular coworking spots with aggregated user stats ("3 builders here now").
- [ ] **City Leaderboards**: "Top active builders in San Francisco this week".
- [ ] **Geo-fencing**: Client-side validation to ensure users are actually at the location they claim (optional strict mode).
- [ ] **Privacy Zones**: Ability to fuzz location for home offices.
