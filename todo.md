- [ ] **Venue Ratings**: Rate locations based on "Wifi Speed", "Coffee Quality", "Noise Level", and "Outlet Availability".

- [ ] **City Leaderboards**: "Top active builders in San Francisco this week".
- [ ] **Geo-fencing**: Client-side validation to ensure users are actually at the location they claim (optional strict mode).
